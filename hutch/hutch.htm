<h1>
Some past and current research projects</h1>

<h2 id="overview">(i) Overview</h2>
My research career has three main strands: (1) a long-term interest in diverse facets of snail and slug biology; (2) experience in numerical
modelling which I have applied mostly to various optimality models of behaviour, life-history
strategies, and morphology; (3) field experience in ornithology. My
first degree was in Zoology at Oxford; I did my doctorate on snail shells with
John Currey at York; for the next 10 years I was at Bristol, working mostly
in behavioural ecology, particularly with <a href="https://royalsociety.org/people/john-mcnamara-11939/">John
McNamara</a>,
<a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Innes-Cuthill-ec647948-439c-4453-85a7-d0dc3f38cc3e/">Innes
Cuthill</a>, and
<a href="https://royalsociety.org/people/alasdair-houston-11651/">Alasdair
Houston</a>.
<p> From September 2000 to December 2006, I held a research-scientist position at the <a HREF="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/concluded-areas/center-for-adaptive-behavior-and-cognition">Center for Adaptive Behavior
and Cognition</a> in the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin. 
I tried to make connections between biological research and the focus of the group, which is 
adaptive decision making in humans using simple heuristics. 
A paper in <i>Behavioural Processes</i> (<a href=#behpro1>Hutchinson &amp; Gigerenzer, 2005</a>) provides a review of 
the group&#8217;s work from a biologist&#8217;s (my) perspective.

<p>Since 2007 I have mostly been collaborating working with my wife <a href="../reise/reise.htm">Heike Reise</a>, studying terrestrial slugs, particularly aspects of their reproduction and life history, although we have got sidetracked into issues of taxonomy and systematics. We share a position in the <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/museum-of-natural-history-goerlitz/zoology/malacology/">Department of Malacology</a> at the <a href="https://museumgoerlitz.senckenberg.de/en/">Senckenberg Museum of Natural History G&#246;rlitz</a>). Much of our time is now taken up with editing the journal <a href="https://www.senckenberg.de/en/science/senckenberg-publications/scientific-journals/archiv-fuer-molluskenkunde/"><i>Archiv für Molluskenkunde</i></a> together with our colleagues in Dresden and Frankfurt, Katrin Schniebs and Julia Sigwart, and our technical editor, Robert Forsyth. We are also involved in a small way in teaching and supervision of students on the masters course "<a href="https://tu-dresden.de/ihi-zittau/studium/studienangebot/biodiversity-collection-management?set_language=en">Biodiversity and Collection Management</a>".

(ii) My former life: mostly behavioural ecology</h2>


<h3 id="starvation">
<u>The starvation/predation trade-off; spreading the risk</u>&#8212;with A.I. Houston &amp; J.M. McNamara</h3>
<a href="#philtrans1">Houston <i>et al.</i> (1993)</a> is a general theoretical discussion of when to perform behaviours differing
in their consequences for starvation and predation; how optimal routines
are altered by stochasticity in the food supply, size-dependent predation,
the presence of a refuge, the chance of interruption, etc. The study is
relevant equally to how flock size, for instance, should vary through the
day, and to when migration or metamorphosis should occur in a life-history.
We used both analytic results and solutions obtained by dynamic programming
to add to (and sometimes to correct) a disparate collection of earlier
work and to put it into a unified conceptual framework. <a href="#contents">Back
to Contents</a>

<h3 id="moult">
<u>When should an arthropod moult?</u>&#8212;with J.M.
McNamara, A.I. Houston &amp; F. Vollrath</h3>
If feeding rates depend on size, and growth depends on feeding rate, when
is it best to moult to a larger size? Our models (<a href="#philtrans2">Hutchinson <i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>) 
tend to predict consistent
increases and decreases in growth ratio and instar duration (rather than
the constant growth ratios of Dyar&#8217;s Rule). However when the number of
instars was also optimised Dyar&#8217;s Rule became a good approximation. We
were concerned to show how to test our model, developing and applying a
statistical technique for cases where individuals can be followed through
successive moults, surveying data in the literature for trends in the population-mean
growth ratios, and showing how to predict the consequences of environmental
manipulations. <a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<h3 id="sing">
<u>When to sing: optimality models using stochastic dynamic programming</u>&#8212;with I.C. Cuthill &amp; J.M. McNamara</h3>
Earlier simple models of energy budgets in a stochastic environment could generate the familiar
dawn and dusk chorus of bird song (see left-hand figure below). Our innovation in 
<a href="#animbehav1">Hutchinson <i>et al.</i>, (1993)</a> was to allow males to
differ in quality and then to seek female choice rules that best distinguished
quality. The best rules involve remembering past song output, or requiring
a continuous bout of song (as do animals relying on phonotaxis). Male singing
routines accordingly adjust to emphasise and prolong the dawn chorus. The
model provides an excellent numerical example of the Handicap Principle
in sexual selection.
<p>In his doctoral research <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/81297-thomas-robert">Robert Thomas</a> confirmed some predictions of these models
experimentally, which inspired us to write a successful NERC grant proposal
to refine the methods of testing. Previous tests of SDP models have simply compared predicted
and observed routines of a whole population, whereas a much more powerful
approach is to study individuals and to test the relationships of behaviour
with state (weight) and of behaviour at one time interval with behaviour
at a preceding time interval. Also earlier empiricists have mistakenly
used short-term manipulations to test published predictions about the consequence 
of long-term manipulations in which the animal has a chance to adapt to
the new environment. <a href="#animbehav2">Hutchinson &amp; McNamara (2000)</a>
is a general paper explaining how to test SDP models; it is aimed at empiricists and uses bird singing routines as a running example. 
<p>Another paper (<a href="#animbehav3">Hutchinson, 2002</a>) concerns the fine structure of the dawn chorus
 when foraging is gradually affected by changing low light levels during twilight. 
This also causes a dawn chorus, but also a characteristic pause as light levels plateau (see right-hand figure below). 
SDP enables two different explanations for the dawn chorus to be incorporated in the same model and their importance compared.

<u>Surface ecology of blue holes</u>&#8212;The Andros Project</h3>
This was an international scientific expedition researching into the biology,

I spent 5 weeks in the field surveying the biota in the surface waters
and immediate vicinity of the cave entrances. The major determinant of
diversity was salinity, which was generally too high to grant this region
of the caves much special conservation value. My paper (<a href="#bluepaper">1998</a>) relates our
data to the work of hydrologists and geologists on the same expedition.

ringers in the Gambia.

<u>Rules of mate choice in patches</u>&#8212;with <a href="https://zeb.uni.wroc.pl/zeb/pl/staff/1-pracownicy/8-konrad-halupka">Konrad Halupka</a></h3>
Males are often distributed patchily, but existing models of mate choice ignore this. 
<a href="#jtbi3">Hutchinson &amp; Halupka (2004)</a> develops a series of theoretical models in which females can inspect the quality of each male in turn,
but delaying acceptance has a cost. 
Some versions allow return to males inspected earlier, and in some versions mean male quality varies systematically between patches or seasons and must be estimated from the quality of males already inspected. 
We derived the optimal female policy, in terms of what quality of male should be acceptable at each stage of search. 
We also compared the performance of simple rules of thumb, both those suggested in the literature and others derived by simplifying the optimal policy. Download pdf of

<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<h3 id="choice">
<u>Is too much choice aversive?</u></h3>
Classically the provision of choice has been regarded as a motivating influence, and this has driven explanations of why it pays males to form leks, why restaurants cluster together, and why cafeteria diets make rats obese. 
But recent results in psychology by Iyengar &amp; Lepper establish that humans can find too much choice aversive and are then less likely to pick any item on offer. 
<a href="#biolrev1">Hutchinson (2005)</a> reviews evidence for similar phenomena in nature, concentrating on leks, food choice and environmental enrichment. 
There are three logically distinct issues: do animals prefer choice, do they consume more when offered a choice, and do they choose better options when more choice is available? 
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>

<h3 id="toilet">
<u>Spatial location and the choice of toilet</u>&#8212;with Michael Bender</h3>
Users of public toilets often endeavour to use a cubicle or urinal that is not next to another occupied one. 
Do they show apparent foresight by avoiding cubicles next to those likely to be taken by users arriving later? 
We tested this with observations from two toilets, one men&#8217;s and one women&#8217;s. 
We argue that this is a good example of the sort of spatial game that humans play all the time without much conscious thought 
(which does not imply that the strategies are not adaptive).

<u>Is risk taking used as a cue in mate choice?</u>&#8212;with <a href="https://webspace.clarkson.edu/~awilke/Home.html">Andreas Wilke</a>, <a href="https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/todd-peter.html">Peter Todd</a> &amp; Dan Kruger
</h3>
It is often supposed that women are attracted to men who take risks, which might explain the elevated risk-taking and mortality in young men. 
We (<a href="#evps1">Wilke <i>et al.</i> 2006)</a> tested this by asking both men and women whether they would find it attractive if someone of the opposite sex took each of 40 different risks described in short text vignettes. 
Both sexes agreed that only social and, to a lesser extent, recreational risk taking was attractive; 
in ethical, health and gambling domains it was unattractive. 
Surprisingly, the less risky a behaviour was rated, the more attractive it was judged.
<p>We also assessed risk attitudes within stable couples, because we thought that those who, say, found climbing very risky might have been attracted by, and paired with, those who had no such concerns about heights. 
Instead we found positive assortment. Perhaps those with similar risk attitudes join the same clubs 
and/or are more compatible once they have paired.

<h3 id="random">
<u>Making predictions from random walks</u>&#8212;with Peter Waser</h3>
Waser used analytic formulae to predict how far a group of
mangabeys should travel in a month or year if they followed a random walk.
Others have reapplied this technique to other mammals. <a href="#func1">Hutchinson (2000)</a> 
considers the effect of relaxing assumptions in the random-walk model,
and uses Monte-Carlo simulation to derive confidence intervals.
<p>Waser also predicted the number of encounters between mangabey groups under the null assumptions of no attraction or avoidance, using the formula used by physicists to predict collisions between molecules in a gas. <a href="#biolrev2">Hutchinson &amp; Waser (2007)</a> review the use of this formula in diverse fields of biology, for instance to predict encounters between predators and prey, sperm and eggs, and observers and the birds that they are censusing. We consider how sensitive the predictions are to the assumptions, partly by comparing with simulations of random walks, and we correct various misuses of the model in the literature.

<h3 id="carpark">
<u>Game theory in car parking</u>&#8212;with <a href="https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/todd-peter.html">Peter Todd</a> and Carola Fanselow</h3>
What simple rules enable you to select a parking space close to your destination? Our computer simulations of simple decision rules demonstrate that the rules used by drivers affect how parked cars are distributed and thus which rules work best. By analysing the statistical structure of the environment created by good rules, we were able to explain which rules outcompeted others in an evolutionary algorithm. Published as a <a href="hutchpub/hutchabs.htm#car1">chapter</a> in a book on <i>Ecological Rationality</i>.
<br>This was linked to a study with Peter Todd and Konstantinos Katsikopoulos using a driving simulator to study parking decisions in this context, but I suspect that that will never see the light of day!

<h3 id="skylark">
<u>Skylark song flights and dynamic games</u>&#8212;with
I.C. Cuthill &amp; J.M. McNamara</h3>
The main question under investigation was to what extent how much one skylark
displays affects how much its neighbours display. One can imagine that
two birds of equal quality escalate their advertisement more than if they
were asymmetric in ability. Catching and colour-ringing two populations
proved to be a considerable challenge which delayed progress and restricted
the intended experimental manipulations (temporary attachment of weights).
I also tried to develop two novel methodologies: (1) an array of 5 microphones
feed into a laptop computer to give a real-time readout in the field of
the singers&#8217; position and sound intensity; (2) analysis of the song suggests
that breathing rate increases when the bird is ascending at the start of
its song flight.
<p>To my shame, I don't think the main project will ever get written up! However, in <a href="#ibis1">Hutchinson & Griffith (2008)</a> we reported a quite high rate of extra-paternity and a greater rate of cuckoldry in smaller fathers. Long periods high above the ground in a song flight may make males vulnerable to cuckoldry. I have also analysed data on seasonal changes in claw and beak length.

<h3 id="crickets">
<u>Optimal trajectories and optimal spacing: crickets
and frogs, predators and prey</u></h3>
If several male crickets are singing but any of them may suddenly disappear
(mated, predated, etc.), I have shown that it is optimal for the females
to follow a curved trajectory, bet-hedging by initially heading between
two rivals. For the same reason, pairs of males close together may be a
more desirable target than one in isolation. Is this a good enough reason
for males to aggregate?

A classic paradigm in behavioural ecology is when to switch from a deteriorating food patch to a fresh one. We examined this decision in humans using a computer game in which subjects earn money by clicking on <a href="#animbehav4">fish</a> that briefly surface in a pond. Some ponds initially have more fish than others, which can be judged from the rate at which fish appear, but caught fish are not replaced. Optimal behaviour should depend only on the number of fish caught at a pond and the time spent there, with the function depending on the distribution of fish across ponds and travel time; we proposed that humans, being extreme generalists, should alter their switching rules according to whether this distribution was aggregated or even. We found little indication for this. The main influences on when to leave were time since the last capture, the preceding interval between captures and time spent in the patch.
<p>In everyday modern life humans often have to make decisions when to switch from one task to another. As an example we have asked subjects to make <a href="#cogsci1">words</a> from a sequence of letters, and studied whether the patch-leaving rules from behavioural ecology explain when they ask for a new sequence. Again time since the last capture and the preceding interval are important determinants of when to switch, but also involved are immediate indications of sequence quality, perhaps gauged from the commonness of the constituent letters. Contrary to optimality predictions, switching rules did not seem to depend on the variation in sequence quality.

<h3 id="bethedge">
<u>Better bet-hedging by using past weather to predict states of relatives: when in spring to germinate</u>&#8212;with John McNamara
</h3>
When environmental fluctuations affect all population members, genotypes with the highest long-term reproductive success may bet-hedge, with identical individuals acting differently. 
Furthermore, it can be advantageous for an individual to base its decisions on the proportion of its relatives in each possible state. 
Normally direct monitoring of this proportion is not feasible. 
However, it might estimate proportions indirectly from the history of weather which all have experienced. 
For illustration we model a seed deciding when during spring to germinate; 
early germination can lead to more offspring, but at increased risk of a lethal frost. 
If a frost kills the early germinating members of the genotype, we predict others should be, counterintuitively, more likely to germinate immediately. 
We examine how the optimal dependence on past weather is affected by perenniality, autocorrelation in weather conditions, and temperature-dependent growth rates. 
Calculating the optimal strategy in the general case is a formidable computational problem.
<p>
In an earlier paper (<a href="#tree1">Hutchinson, 1996</a>), I reviewed some recent developments of the theory of bet-hedging in fluctuating environments.

<u>Design in the shell shape of a terrestrial snail, <i>Trichia hispida</i></u>&#8212;D. Phil., supervisor Prof. J.D. Currey</h3>
It is a beauty of the gastropod shell that it can be sectioned to reveal
each developmental step in its construction. Previous models have been
based on the isometric logarithmic spiral. My models instead followed from
the mechanical constraints and cues which are likely to influence the animal&#8217;s
choice of where to secrete the next length of tube (e.g. <a href="#jtbi1">Hutchinson, 1989</a>). Calculation of the
geometric consequences of these rules enabled me to test these models against
patterns of variation in the dimensions of sectioned shells. 
A conference abstract available <a href="hutchpub/siena_abs.htm">here</a> provides a useful summary. 
For my criticism of an alternative approach see <a href="#jmorph1">Hutchinson (1990a</a>).

<p>Other aspects of the research included: (1) biomechanics&#8212;measuring
strength of shells to relate it to their size, thickness, shape and colour;
(2) quantitative genetics&#8212;a statistical reanalysis of W.F.R. Weldon&#8217;s classic

<h3 id="fauna">
<u>Faunistic work on terrestrial slugs and snails</u>&#8212;with Heike Reise</h3>
Most of the slugs and snails found in synanthropic habitats in North America are from Europe.
Because there are relatively few workers on slugs and snails there, we have succeeded 
in finding several new species there that have not previously been recognised. Our publications of these finds 
include reviews of each species&#8217; biology and ecology: 
<A href="#veliger1"><i>Boettgerilla pallens</i></A> (an <a href="#chkl1">update</a> reviews further North American records), <A href="#amb1"><i>Aegopinella nitidula</i></A> and 
<A href="#veliger2"><i>Tandonia budapestensis</i></A>. 
The latter species has considerable scope for becoming a pest, as does 
<A href="#veliger2"><i>Derocereas invadens</i></A>, 
whose range we have considerably extended into the Eastern USA. Most recently we have surveyed a range of 
synanthropic habitats in the Denver region of Colorado and the Salt Lake City region of Utah.

In Europe, we have extended the range of the slug 
<i>Deroceras turcicum</i>, initially to the <A href="#fom1">Czech Republic and Slovakia</A>, 
and later to <A href="#fom2">Poland</A>. Our paper (<A href="#fom1">Reise &amp; Hutchinson, 2001</A>) 
also discusses its considerable range of morphological variation so as to facilitate identification. By chance, we were the first to collect the introduced carnivorous slug <i><A href="#jconch2">Selenochlamys ysbryda</a></i>, from a churchyard in Wales, although we were too slow-witted to appreciate it at the time! A finding of <i><a href="#mdmg3">Milax nigricans</a></i> in northern France prompted us to review other occurrences outside its natural range and to highlight which identification characters are most reliable. A couple of papers examine the synanthropic slug fauna in our own town of <a href="#bngo4">G&#246;rlitz</a> and over the adjacent border in <a href="#fom4">Polish Silesia</a>. Another discovery was that of <a href="#mdmg6"><i>Monacha claustralis</i></a>, found on a field meeting of the <a href="https://www.dmg.mollusca.de/">Deutsche Malakozoologische Gesellschaft</a> near Jena; this was the first report from Germany, but to be expected given its spread in Poland and the Czech Republic. A collaboration with Turkish colleagues led to a <a href="#fom6">publication</a> on the spread of <i>Arion ater</i> s.l. to Istanbul.

<h3 id="mating">
<u>Mating behaviour of <i>Deroceras</i> slugs</u>&#8212;with Heike Reise</h3>
Following Reise's (2007) review of mating in this genus, she and I are examining the mating behaviour of further species. Partly this is to try to understand the function of various parts of the genital anatomy, on which the taxonomy of this genus is largely based. One such approach is to examine mating behaviour in species in which the genitalia are extreme, and an example is our paper on <a href="#anbiol1"><i>D. gorgonium</i></a> from Crete, which has a very large penial gland. More recently we have examined mating behaviour in <i>D. helicoidale</i> from Turkey which has a long spiral penis.
<br>
Another reason for examining mating behaviour is to provide extra characters for taxonomy. For example, by studying the mating behaviour of <i>Deroceras</i> collected in the S&#228;chsische Schweiz, we have recognised that <i>D. rodnae</i> needs to be split into at least two species with very different courtship and copulation behaviours (<a href="ss.htm">link to paper and videos</a>). Another example is our discovery that the mating behaviour of the widespread pest species formerly known as <i>D. panormitanum</i> does not correspond to that of the species originally described under this name, prompting us to redescribe the pest species as <i>Deroceras invadens</i> (<a href="malta.htm">link to videos</a>). Most recently it was the distinctive mating behaviour of <a href="#afm1"><i>Deroceras cecconii</i></a> that made us realise that this long-ignored species really was valid; it turns out to be rather common and widespread in Italy. Observations of its mating behaviour was valuable also in establishing homologies between the functionally important parts of its penis and those of related species.
<br>
Our observations of mating behaviour have been much facilitated by the development of a digital video system based on security systems.

<h3 id="invasion">
<u>The worldwide spread of the slug <i>Deroceras invadens</i></u>&#8212;with Heike Reise, Bettina Schlitt, Tereza Ko&#345;inkov&#225;, David Robinson and Gary Barker
</h3>
In a thorough review (<a href="#neob1">Hutchinson et al. 2014</a>) we  established which countries this species has colonised, when it was first recorded in each, and in which habitats and climates it occurs. Although we trawled the literature carefully, our own collections and those of various museums considerably extended the range, particularly in the Americas. Conversely, some museum specimens and published records turned out to be misidentifications. Subsequently work in our own backyard documented a second <a href="#fom4">colonisation of Poland</a>. Most recently, by sequencing part of the mitochondrial COI gene, we have further investigated the likely origin of this species, its routes of spread, and its genetic diversity (<a href="#jms6">Hutchinson et al. 2020</a>). The much greater diversity of COI, anatomy and mating behaviour in southern Italy and Sicily implies that this is its native range; this is also the only region where there is a correlation between genetic and geographic distances apart. Another important result is that, although <i>D. invadens</i> has colonised both North America and Australia long ago, import controls mean that some very common haplotypes in Europe are absent or very rare in these continents. Our collecting trips in Italy have, as a by-product, established the range of related species such as <i>D. panormitanum</i>.

<h3 id="allometry">
<u>Allometry of genitalia size in <i>Arion</i> slugs</u>&#8212;with Heike Reise
</h3>
Arion slugs are hermaphrodites with a long courtship finishing with reciprocal exchange of freshly manufactured spermatophores via everted genitalia. 
Is size of the distal genitalia (parts involved in spermatophore manufacture, exchange and digestion, and sometimes stroking the partner) sexually selected: i.e. do large individuals invest in relatively large genitalia to increase mating success? 
Alternatively, genitalia much larger than the partner&#8217;s could cause incompatibility. 
For five species collected throughout the year from one site, we weighed each slug, then dissected out the reproductive tract (see project on <a href="#lifecycle"><i>Arion</i> life cycles</a>). 
Relative weights of its proximal parts indicated maturity. 
As slugs mature the distal genitalia grow disproportionately fast, but within adults they scale with slight negative allometry (cf. isometry of the digestive gland and slight positive allometry of the whole reproductive tract). 
Interspecifically the relationship is isometric. 
The two almost obligate selfing species have relatively smaller genitalia than similarly sized congeners.
<p>
We have since measured allometry of various components of the reproductive system of the terrestrial snail <i>Helix pomatia</i> and the freshwater basommatophorans <i>Stagnicola corvus</i> and <i>Stagnicola turricula</i>. This was in collaboration with Bartek Go&#322;dyn and Tereza Ko&#345;&#237;nkov&#225;.

Reise <i>et al.</i> (<a href="#malabh1">2001</a>) described a sinistral specimen of <i>Arion lusitanicus</i>; 
this is only the 5th sinistral individual reported for any slug species. 
Our attempts to mate our specimen with dextral conspecifics indicated that it was incapable of proceeding far with courtship. 
We discussed the possible genetic basis of sinistrality in slugs, given the absence of sinistral siblings of three of the sinistral specimens reported.


<h3 id="praecox">
<u>Species boundaries in <i>Deroceras</i> slugs</u>&#8212;with Heike Reise and Stefanie Visser
</h3>
<i>Deroceras</i> is the most speciose genus of terrestrial slugs; 
most species are externally indistiguishable but distinctive in their genitalia and mating behaviour. 
We have been mapping zones of contact between <i>D. praecox</i> and <i>D. rodnae</i> in the mountains of southern Poland 
and between <i>D. praecox</i> and <i>D. fatrense</i> in the Mala Fatra mountains of Slovakia. 
The species overlap very little. At one site a narrow mountain stream marks the border, but the genital morphology suggests some hybrids just where bridges cross.
<p>In the Elbsandsteingebirge south of Dresden <i>D. rodnae</i> co-occurs with <i>D. juranum</i>, but they have a very narrow parapatric distribution, seeming not to correspond with any landscape features. These two species are closely related but never hybridise.

On holiday in Sardinia, we came across several populations of the endemic <i>Ariunculus isselii</i>, a slug that externally one might suppose was a species of <i>Arion</i>. It has indeed often been placed within <i>Arion</i>, but we had a big surprise when we dissected slugs killed during or after mating: unlike <i>Arion</i>,  <i>A. isselii</i> does not use a spermatophore to transfer sperm. <a href="hutchpub/hutchabs.htm#jms4">Our paper</a> reviews the taxonomy of the genus, describes the mating behaviour of <i>A. isselii</i> , redescribes its genital anatomy, and attempts to interpret how the genitalia are used.

<u>Life cycles of five syntopic species of <i>Arion</i> slugs</u>&#8212;with Heike Reise & Grita Skuijen&#279;
</h3>
In Britain, several species of <i>Arion</i> slug may coexist at the same site. These species differ considerably in size, but do different timings of their life cycles also help them to coexist? Between 1998 and 2016, whenever I passed Leigh Delamere M4 Services I tried to sample the adjacent patch of woodland, collecting every individual seen of the five <i>Arion</i> species present. All individuals were preserved, then weighed. A sample were dissected and components of the reproductive tract weighed; the ratios of weights indicate maturity. This estimate was calibrated by rearing eggs to adulthood in captivity or keeping wild-collected individuals until they mated or laid eggs. All species were predominantly annual, with the possibility in some of a minority delaying reproduction until 18 months. Species tended to become mature at different times of year, the ordering matching the ranking of adult size. However, at each time of year species overlapped considerably in body size (except that the two largest species predominated in summer, when the other species were mostly hidden underground). Individuals maturing later were smaller (although individuals of <i>A. intermedius</i> were highly synchronised in when they became adult). Consequently adult size varies considerably within, as well as between, species (the ratios between maximum and minimum adult masses of each species are 5.9&#8211;9.5, and between quartiles1.5&#8211;2.8; median adult mass varied between the smallest and largest species by a factor of 54). In our <a href="#jms5">paper</a> we have compared this with intraspecific variation in adult size in other pulmonates.
