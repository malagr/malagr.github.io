<h1>Cuervos, Bonobos y Otros Espejos Donde Vernos
</h1>
While working at the <a HREF="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/adaptive-behavior-and-cognition">Center for Adaptive Behavior
and Cognition</a> at the Max Plank Institute for Human Development in Berlin, I was interviewed for this documentary on decision making.
<br>
<br>The four-minute section dealing with my work is available <a href="redes.avi">here</a> (download the 10 Mb video file and play with e.g. Windows Media Player; you may need to download an Xvid codec, available from <a href="https://www.xvid.com/download/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.xvidmovies.com/codec">here</a>). The commentary is in Spanish, but, even if you can't follow that, you can watch me (!) and also see the interesting MPIB building where I worked. The weather in Berlin is really not always like this!
<br>
<br>
The Redes web site still provides a <a href="http://www.rtve.es/tve/b/redes2007/semanal/prg396/index.html">description</a> of the programme.
