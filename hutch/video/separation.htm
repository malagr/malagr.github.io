<h3>
DREIJERS, E, REISE, H. &amp; HUTCHINSON, J.M.C. 2013. Mating of the slugs <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> auct. non Mabille and <i>A. rufus</i> (L.): different genitalia and mating behaviours are incomplete barriers to interspecific sperm exchange. <i>Journal of Molluscan Studies</i> <b>79</b>: 51â€“63.</h3>

In this one-minute video we see an individual of <i>Arion vulgaris</i> (top left, redder individual) at the end of a copulation with <i>Arion ater</i>. Intraspecific matings of <i>A. ater</i> last only half the time as long as those of <i>A. vulgaris</i>, so the <i>A. ater</i> individual is already trying to separate and has retracted its genitalia whilst the <i>A. vulgaris</i> individual is still stationary. Nevertheless both have already prepared a spermatophore, and we can observe as they separate that both partners receive these tube-shaped structures. At the end of the video the tail of the recieved spermatophore is still visible sticking out of each genital pore. Please read the <a href="../hutchpub/jms3.htm">article</a> for further details (but note that in it <i>A. lusitanicus</i> = <i>A vulgaris</i> and <i>A. rufus</i> = <i>A. ater</i>). It is the same copulation as illustrated in Figure 1.
