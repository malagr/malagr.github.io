<h1>The video didn&#146;t work!
</h1>
This is a flash video set up to run using <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/blog/jw-player-47-released/">JW FLV Media Player 4.7 </a> and embedded using the static method of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">swfobject 2.2</a>. This should load up the video even without Javascript support.
<p>
In Internet Explorer, check that you have clicked any prompt on the information bar to allow active content and that you have not disallowed ActiveX altogether (Internet options/Security/Internet/Custom Level).
<p>
Most likely the problem is an old version of Adobe Flash Player in your current browser.

To install or update click (but watch out to untick the OPTIONAL OFFERS)

  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html">Test</a> 
  your current AFP installation.
<br>It sometimes helps to <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/141/tn_14157.html">deinstall</a> your old version first.
<p>
However, <b>if you don&#146;t have administrator access, Internet Explorer won&#146;t let you update</b> (but is silent about why not). In Firefox, there may be a workaround for this problem by downloading the update files manually and copying them to the necessary folders.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise the best I can do is provide access to an .avi mpg4 Xvid version of the videos; if you click on the links, your video player (e.g. Windows Media Player) should open and run it. You may need to upgrade to the latest version or download the Xvid codec.
