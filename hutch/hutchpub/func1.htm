<h1>Update</h1>
Similar papers giving formulas for net displacement seem to crop up regularly in various parts of the biological literature, often in apparent ignorance of each other.
<br>
I recommend <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.08.007">Benhamou (2004)</a>, which considers the validity of formulas for net displacement for a correlated random walk, pointing out that there are better methods to characterise movement patterns.
<br>
<a href="hutchabs.htm#biolrev2">Hutchinson & Waser (2007)</a> criticise the encounter-rate component of the Barrett & Lowen (1998) and Waser (1976) papers.
