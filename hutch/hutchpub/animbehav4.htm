<h1>J.M.C. Hutchinson, A. Wilke &amp; P.M. Todd 2008. Patch leaving in humans: can a generalist adapt its rules to dispersal of items across patches? <i>Animal Behaviour</i> <b>75:</b> 1331&#150;1349.</h1>
<br>
Despite Elsevier's endeavors to obscure the fact, <i>Animal Behaviour</i> allows authors to put a copy of the pdf on their personal WEB page. This is a lovely journal to publish in.

<h2>Update
</h2>
We overlooked one very relevant study by <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0162-3095(86)90001-4">Hart & Jackson (1986)</a> in which human subjects foraged for sultanas hung out on artificial bushes.
<br>
<br>
Here is a link to our <a href="hutchabs.htm#cogsci1">companion paper</a> on switching between anagram tasks.
<br>
<br>
The following paper is particularly relevant in showing that bumblebees succeed where humans failed: they can change from an incremental rule to a decremental one dependent on recent foraging experience. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/603629">Biernaskie, Walker &amp; Gegear (2009)</a> Bumblebees learn to forage like Bayesians. <i>Am. Nat.</i> <b>147</b>: 413&#150;423.
<br> 
<br>
Our work has stimulated another computer foraging game: <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0014251">Lou&#226;pre P., van Alphen J.J.M., Pierre J.-S., (2010)</a> Humans and insects decide in similar ways. <i>PLoS ONE</i> <b>5</b>(12): e14251.<br>
The results are quite a contrast to ours and I discuss in an online <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/comment?id=10.1371/annotation/77b3f78d-895e-434d-a328-ff47265ed5de">comment</a> on the article why this might be so.
