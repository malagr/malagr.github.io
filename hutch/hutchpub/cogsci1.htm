Alternatively I provide here a pdf file that we have to say is a prepublished, uncorrected version of an article that later appeared in <i>Cognitive Science</i>. However, we are not aware of any changes between this version and what appeared in the journal. <i>Cognitive Science</i> is published by Wiley-Blackwell and copyright is held by the Cognitive Science Society.
