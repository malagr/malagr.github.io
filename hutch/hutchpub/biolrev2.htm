Blackwells have rather a Draconian policy of not allowing pdf files to be posted on personal WEB pages. Instead I offer a file generated from an updated version of the final submission, which I think does not differ in content from the published version. You are also very welcome to email me for a pdf of the published version.

<h2>Errata
</h2>
I apologise for three similar errors in formulae concerned with calculating length of a relative trajectory.
<br>Formula 23 should read 2<i>D</i>&#8730;(<i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> &#150; 2<i>uv</i> cos <i>&#952;</i>), NOT 2<i>D</i>&#8730;(<i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> &#150; <i>uv</i> cos <i>&#952;</i>) as printed.
<br>In the caption to Figure 9, the trajectory of the herring relative to the jellyfish should have length <i>t</i>&#8730;(<i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> &#150; 2<i>uv</i> cos <i>&#952;</i>), NOT <i>t</i>&#8730;(<i>u</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>v</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>uv</i> cos <i>&#952;</i>) as printed.
<br>The same mistake has occurred in the caption to Figure 10.
<br>These careless errors have not affected anything else in the MS (e.g. Formula 31 or quantitative results).
<br>Also, in the last sentence of the caption to Fig. 1, 4<i>vt</i>/&#960; should be the mean relative trajectory length, not mean relative speed, which is given correctly in formula (1) as 4<i>v</i>/&#960;.
<br>
<i>Biological Reviews</i> has now published a <a href="biolrev3.pdf"><b>corrigendum</b></a> advertising the above errors.
<br>I am grateful to Thomas Clerc for identifying a further error. Formula (15) refers to the number of encounters, not their rate.
