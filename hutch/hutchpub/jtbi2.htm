In correspondence, we have discussed the necessity of using quadratic rather than linear interpolation. My further analyses suggest that linear regression can be adequate, but that quadratic often yields greater accuracy (each involved interpolation of logged values, in contrast with results reported in the <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/highwire/filestream/28362/field_highwire_adjunct_files/0/rstb20072053supp1.pdf">supplementary material</a> to Crabbe, 2007). With rather flat fitness landscapes (low probabilities of disappearance), both can be inadequate.
