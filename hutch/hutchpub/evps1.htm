<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/147470490700500406">Farthing (2007)</a>, using a similar methodology, also found that taking mild risks was more attractive than taking high risks.

<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/147470490800600104">Pawlowski, Atwal &amp; Dunbar (2008)</a> observed risk taking in crossing a road and arriving at a bus stop. Men took more risks, and were more likely to cross a road in front of traffic if they had a female audience.
