<p>Our experimental set-up. The top line represents the choice available to the subject if a neighbor is avoided (the seven cubicles are shown in plan view; the two locked end cubicles are shown occupied, as the subject will imagine them to be). The next line shows the resulting possible patterns of occupancy (choice of Cubicle 4 is not shown because the situation is the mirror image of that when Cubicle 2 is occupied). The bottom lines show the likely patterns of occupancy if another user arrives before any others leave, assuming that this user also tries to avoid neighbors (not possible if Cubicle 3 is taken).
