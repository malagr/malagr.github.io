Full-screen view of the experiment in progress. Three fish have been caught at the current pond (see right-hand panel and bucket) and the end of the fishing line is moving towards a fourth fish lying at 9 o’clock. It must be clicked on within 2 s before it disappears. “Neuer Teich?” labels a red button to switch pond.

Thanks to Uwe Czienskowski for creating this graphic and programming the experiment.
