The taxi parable. (a) What is the customer's optimal trajectory towards two taxis that someone else may occupy at any time? The dashed lines are alternative trajectories (straight or curved). If the left-hand taxi disappeared the customer would head straight to the remaining taxi (dotted lines). (b) Should the customer head for a pair of taxis even though a solitary taxi is nearere?(c) Assuming customers behave optimally, should a taxi park next to another?
