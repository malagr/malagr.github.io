<h2>Update
</h2>Three new vice-county records reported by Ben Rowson are published in:
Norris, A. 2010 Non-marine recording&#151;activity and highlights 2009. <i>Mollusc World</i> <b>23</b>:13&#150;14. These are from Knowle, Bristol (VC 6), Newport (VC 35), and Caerphilly (VC 41). Two of these records appear to predate our record, but this is an error: they all postdate it (B. Rowson, personal communication 7.3.11).
