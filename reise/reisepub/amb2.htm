The <i>American Malacalogical Bulletin</i> provides a pdf file to authors without restriction on distribution.

The editorial office saw fit to make a large number of alterations to my submitted MS. Whilst some of these were improvements, they also introduced a substantial number of errors or unintended changes of meaning. I managed to get many of these reversed at the proofs stage, but, despite my begging entreaties, the editor refused to modify some phrases that substantially altered my original meaning (e.g. &#34;very variable&#34; had been replaced by &#34;quite variable&#34;). Accordingly, the pdf that I make available below has some corrections marked using Adobe's text-editing tool.
