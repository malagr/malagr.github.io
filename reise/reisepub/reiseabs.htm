The mating behaviour of <i>Deroceras rodnae</i> Grossu & Lupu, 1965 and <i>D. praecox</i> Wiktor, 1966 was observed under laboratory conditions. Both species differ by the shape and functioning of the sarcobelum, the timing and duration of courtship and the colour of the sperm mass. Particularly the different timing of the courtship behaviour seems to act as an effective prezygotic isolation mechanism preventing interspecific crosses. Usually, sperm masses are exchanged mutually. In three homospecific pairings, unilateral sperm transfer was observed followed by a characteristic behaviour of the donor slug. This observation is discussed in light of the hermaphrodite's dilemma and sperm trading models.

The terrestrial slug <i>Deroceras juranum</i> W&#252;thrich, 1993 (Gastropoda: Agriolimacidae) has been described as an endemic species of the Swiss Jura Mountains (Switzerland) where it occurs at high altitudes. The species description was mainly based on its characteristic blackish-violet body colour. Breeding experiments and comparative studies of the genital anatomy and mating behaviour indicate that D. juranum is nothing but a colour morph of the usually cream-coloured D. rodnae Grossu & Lupu, 1965. The body colour seems to be coded by a single locus with two alleles, of which violet is dominant over cream. Topographical colour variation has also been observed in arionid slugs. Its possible biological (i.e. selective?) meaning is discussed. The slugs are able to reproduce uniparentally with their offspring showing recombination.

The terrestrial slug <i>Boettgerilla pallens</i> Simroth, 1912, is reported
from two sites on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, the first records
for this Palaearctic species in America. This paper describes how to recognise
the species, and summarises European studies of its ecology. It is unusually
worm-like in appearance, lives mostly underground, and occurs in a very
wide range of habitats. This century the species has spread remarkably
far and fast across Europe from the Caucasus. This is demonstrated by a
table of first occurrences in each country, and by three case studies of
spread within Great Britain, Belgium and north-west Austria. We predict
that it will spread rapidly in North America, and may already occur more
widely, but there is no evidence that it will become an important pest.

We report seven new localities of the terrestrial slug <i>Deroceras turcicum</i> (Simroth), including the first occurrences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. These demonstrate that the distribution of <i>D. turcicum</i> extends much further north than known previously and it might even be rather common there. We discuss possible reasons for its belated discovery. <i>D. turcicum</i> might have often been confused not only with the common <i>D. reticulatum</i> (O.F. M&#252;ll.) but also with the syntopical <i>D. rodnae</i> Grossu et Lupu and <i>D. praecox</i> Wiktor. We describe its variability in size, coloration, genital morphology, and caecum length, and consider characters for its reliable discrimination from other species. Two colour morphs (white and violet) are described for the first time. Intriguingly, the coloration of <i>D. turcicum</i> often matches that of congeners found at the same site, which suggests that colour has some selective value. Since external appearance often gives no reason to suspect that two species are present at a site, dissection of several specimens is advisable.

A juvenile sinistral specimen of <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> was found near M&#252;nster (Germany, Nordrhein-Westfalen) and raised in isolation. Its entire external and internal morphology is a mirror image of normal dextral slugs. In mating experiments with dextral individuals the partners showed clear courtship behaviour but were never successful. This was probably caused by the opposite position of their genital pores, which might make copulation impossible for mirror-image slugs. Reports of sinistral terrestrial slugs are very rare. The authors review earlier cases, and discuss the possible genetic basis of sinistrality in slugs.

Mating in <i>Deroceras</i> consists of an investigation phase (precourtship), then a long courtship involving mutual stroking with the extruded sarcobelum, then sperm exchange (copulation). The penial gland, if present, everts over the partner&#146;s skin during copulation: this is hypothesised to apply a secretion manipulating the partner to use received sperm. <i>Deroceras gorgonium</i> has a particularly large penial gland, divided into many finger-like branches. We studied <i>D. gorgonium</i> mating behaviour in the hope of further indications of the gland&#146;s function. Precourtship and courtship together last longer than in other <i>Deroceras</i> (c. 6 h to >9 h); precourtship is highly variable, often with many bouts of different behaviours, including seemingly inactive phases. During most of the courtship partners remain apart waving their particularly long, pointed sarcobela; only at a later stage do the tips of these contact the partner. This waving alternates with circling for half a turn. For the first time in <i>Deroceras</i> we observed the sarcobelum transferring a secretion. The copulation is amongst the fastest: genital eversion and sperm exchange occur within 1 s, and slugs separate 18&#150;25 s later. The penial gland is everted immediately after sperm exchange, but, surprisingly, is often spread underneath the partner rather than over its back and, if on top, is not always fully spread over the partner&#146;s body. We discuss these observations with respect to penial gland morphology and in the light of possible sexual conflicts. The long courtship and distant sarcobelum waving might reflect attempts to transfer, but not receive, secretion, and the circling might serve size assessment.

H. Reise 2007. A review of mating behavior in slugs of the genus <i>Deroceras</i> (Pulmonata: Agriolimacidae). <i>American Malacalogical Bulletin</i> <b>23</b>:137&#150;156.
</h2>
The genus <i>Deroceras</i> Rafinesque, 1820 (the largest genus of terrestrial slugs) shows a high diversity of penis morphologies and mating behaviors. The function of most of the appending external and internal penis structures, some of them truly bizarre, is largely unknown. This paper reviews mating behavior and reproduction, based on data on 16 species from the literature and unpublished observations. I analyze patterns common to all <i>Deroceras</i> species, and differences among species. The general mating pattern consists of a long courtship with mutual stroking with a sarcobelum, a sudden penis eversion and external sperm exchange (copulation). I distinguish also precourtship and withdrawal phases. Sperm exchange is usually very quick but, in a few species, occupies a considerable proportion of the total mating duration. Mutual sperm exchange is the rule. Species differences involve the durations of certain mating phases, presence and nature of initial trail following, nature and intensity of stroking (including the degree of contact with the sarcobelum), aggressiveness of courtship behavior, and the timing of the penial gland eversion. I hypothesize that the radiation of mating behaviors and associated structures may have been driven by an arms race resulting from conflicting interests of mating partners over sperm donation and use. This could also have increased the rate of speciation in Deroceras. There are indications for the presence of sperm competition and conflicting interests between mating partners: individuals mate repeatedly, can store and digest sperm, and simultaneously use sperm from different mating partners for egg fertilization. Some details of mating behavior also suggest conflict. The timing of the penial gland eversion after sperm exchange suggests a manipulation akin to the role of love darts in helicid snails. Finally, some recommendations for studying mating behavior in <i>Deroceras</i> are given.

</h2>
Collections of <i>Deroceras</i> from the uplands south of Dresden (along the Czech-German border) revealed two similar species differing in mating behaviour. The ranges interdigitate, but the species never occurred together. Species A has a wide sarcobelum held leftwards over its head and the everted penes are fully visible from above. It most resembles <i>Deroceras praecox</i>, occurring 100 km further east, whose anatomy and courtship behaviour are nevertheless consistently distinct; if these are different species, species A appears endemic to the S&#228chsische Schweiz. In species B, courtship and copulation take longer. Its sarcobelum is narrower, with a much enlarged base, and is directed forward or to the right. Most distinct is that the penes evert downwards and coil round each other for an additional revolution; their eversion is hidden from above except for the hand-like penial gland. This species is conspecific with Swiss, German and Austrian populations of <i>Deroceras rodnae</i>, but distinct from eastern populations, which more closely resemble <i>D. praecox</i> and species A. Unpublished molecular analyses support this division. Nevertheless, identifying non-mating animals by genital anatomy can be difficult: the base of the sarcobelum provides the best character. Western populations of <i>D. rodnae</i> should be termed <i>Deroceras juranum</i> W&#252;thrich, 1993.

</h2>
Competition for fertilisation in hermaphroditic animals seems to have led to many odd behaviours and complex morphologies involved in the transfer of accessory-gland products to the partner. Terrestrial slugs of the genus <i>Deroceras</i> show remarkably elaborate and interspecifically diverse penis morphologies and mating behaviours. Most species have an appending penial gland, which in <i>Deroceras panormitanum</i> consists of a few long fingers that are everted after sperm exchange and laid onto the partner&#146;s back. To investigate whether this gland transfers a secretion onto the partner&#146;s skin, we killed slugs at different mating stages and studied their penial glands and skin histologically. Two types of secretion granules appeared at a very early stage of courtship, and the penial gland was already filled 15 min into the courtship. At copulation, the gland everted this secretion onto the partner&#146;s body, where it remained for at least 50 min. No lysis of skin tissue or other effects on the skin were observed. The slugs tried to lick the received secretion off their own body, and some droplets were observed to be shed with the body mucus. Our results indicate the external application of a glandular substance that could function as either a pheromone or allohormone. The behaviours of the recipients suggest sexual conflict, although mutual interest cannot be ruled out.

</h2>
The name <i>Deroceras panormitanum</i> is generally applied to a terrestrial slug that has spread worldwide and can be a pest; earlier this tramp species had been called <i>Deroceras caruanae</i>. Neither name is appropriate. The taxonomic descriptions apply to a species from Sicily and Malta. This true <i>D. panormitanum</i> and the tramp species are distinct in morphology and mating behaviour. For instance, the penial caecum of <i>D. panormitanum</i> is more pointed, everting faster at copulation. The size of the penial lobe varies considerably in preserved specimens but is always prominent at copulation. <i>D. panormitanum</i> is distinct from the Maltese endemic <i>Deroceras golcheri</i>, but a phylogeny based on COI mtDNA implies that they are more closely related than is the tramp species. <i>D. golcheri</i> has a still closer counterpart on Sicily, but we leave the taxonomy of this &#147;species X&#148; unresolved. In interspecific crosses, <i>D. panormitanum</i> may transfer sperm to the partner&#146;s sarcobelum whereas the partner fails to evert its penis (<i>D. golcheri</i>) or to transfer sperm (the tramp species). Names previously applied to the tramp species originally referred to <i>D. panormitanum</i> or are otherwise invalid, so it is here formally redescribed as <i>D. invadens</i>. <i>Deroceras giustianum</i> Wiktor, 1998 is synonymised with <i>D. panormitanum</i>.

</h2>
The large slug known as <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> (or <i>A. vulgaris</i>) is an important pest that is spreading through much of Europe. <i>Arion rufus</i> disappears at sites where <i>A. lusitanicus</i> has established strong populations. The finding of morphological intermediates suggests that <i>A. lusitanicus</i> hybridizes with <i>A. rufus</i>, but interspecific mating had not been proven. Considering the marked differences in their genitalia, it has been hard to envisage how mixed couples might transfer sperm. <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> and <i>A. rufus</i> were collected from pure populations near G&#246;rlitz, Germany, and used for laboratory mating trials involving either two individuals of <i>A. rufus</i> (henceforth RR), two of <i>A. lusitanicus</i> (LL), or one of each species (mixed). Matings were video recorded and some couples were killed during or after copulation to study spermatophore transfer and genital anatomy during mating. Three mixed pairs copulated. However, mixed pairs were significantly less likely to copulate than either RR or LL pairs (7% vs 52% and 36%). At each stage of mating, the probability of proceeding further was lower in mixed pairs than predicted from rates in RR and LL pairs, but this effect was strongest for yin-yang formation and initiating copulation. One problem was that <i>A. lusitanicus</i> tried to circle after yin-yang formation, whereas <i>A. rufus</i> remained stationary. In this respect, and in the repositioning of its everted oviduct, it was <i>A. lusitanicus</i> that compromised. LL copulations lasted over twice as long as RR copulations, but spermatophore formation took similar times, permitting reciprocal spermatophore exchange in mixed couples even though their copulations ended much earlier than in LL pairs. Our observations of mating behaviour of intraspecific pairs largely agree with previous descriptions of <i>A. rufus</i>, but we discuss some discrepancies with the fuller descriptions available for <i>A. lusitanicus</i>.

The invasive pest slug <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> (also known as <i>Arion vulgaris</i>) has spread throughout much of Europe within the last 60 years, becoming one of the worst agricultural and horticultural pest species. It has now been detected in Romania for the first time. There are dense populations at two sites in Bra&#351;ov County (2013) and another occurrence in Mure&#351; County (2012). We review occurrences in neighbouring countries and discuss evidence that <i>A. lusitanicus</i> might have arrived in Romania earlier. Further research on the species&#146; spread in Romania and on its impact on the native fauna and flora is necessary.<br>

<i>Neobiota</i> <b>23</b>: 17&#150;64.
</h2>
The article reviews distribution records of <i>Deroceras invadens</i> (previously called <i>D. panormitanum</i> and <i>D. caruanae</i>), adding significant unpublished records from the authors&#146; own collecting, museum samples, and interceptions on goods arriving in the U.S.A. By 1940 <i>D. invadens</i> had already arrived in Britain, Denmark, California, Australia and probably New Zealand; it has turned up in many further places since, including remote oceanic islands, but scarcely around the eastern Mediterranean (Egypt and Crete are the exceptions), nor in Asia. Throughout much of the Americas its presence seems to have been previously overlooked, probably often being mistaken for <i>D. laeve</i>. New national records include Mexico, Costa Rica, and Ecuador, with evidence from interceptions of its presence in Panama, Peru, and Kenya. The range appears limited by cold winters and dry summers; this would explain why its intrusion into eastern Europe and southern Spain has been rather slow and incomplete. At a finer geographic scale, the occurrence of the congener <i>D. reticulatum</i> provides a convenient comparison to control for sampling effort; <i>D. invadens</i> is often about half as frequently encountered and sometimes predominates. <i>Deroceras invadens</i> is most commonly found in synanthropic habitats, particularly gardens and under rubbish, but also in greenhouses, and sometimes arable land and pasture. It may spread into natural habitats, as in Britain, South Africa, Australia and Tenerife. Many identifications have been checked in the light of recent taxonomic revision, revealing that the sibling species <i>D. panormitanum</i> s.s. has spread much less extensively. A number of published or online records, especially in Australia, have turned out to be misidentifications of <i>D. laeve</i>.<br>

</h2>
<i>Ariunculus</i> is a genus of terrestrial slugs often treated as a subgenus of <i>Arion</i>. A survey of the literature reveals doubts about many of the described species: only <i>A. speziae</i> and <i>A. isselii</i> are now generally recognized as belonging to <i>Ariunculus</i>. <i>Ariunculus isselii</i> is widespread on Sardinia. We describe its external appearance, mating behaviour and genital anatomy, and interpret the functioning of the genitalia based on specimens killed during copulation or shortly afterwards. Instead of the distinct epiphallus of <i>Arion</i>, there is only a small ampulla, because sperm are pumped out piecemeal to the recipient rather than transferred in a spermatophore. We speculate (in a framework of sexual selection theory) that this may explain why mating lasts 12 h after the initial genital eversion, much longer than in most <i>Arion</i>. The absence of a spermatophore provides grounds for keeping <i>Ariunculus</i> separate from <i>Arion</i>. Similarly to some <i>Arion</i> species, the papilla is inserted into the partner&#146;s partially everted bursa trunk; we discuss four different hypotheses for the function of this arrangemet. Also as in some <i>Arion</i> species, the oviduct is everted during mating so as to apply a ligula. We provide information on egg laying in captivity and report that the species can self-fertilize.

</h2>
The slug fauna of gardens in the town of G&#246;rlitz was investigated by hand searching 14 house gardens, 13 allotments and four courtyards. The 13 species that were found were, in decreasing order of occurrence, <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> auct. non Mabille, <i>Deroceras reticulatum</i>, <i>Arion distinctus</i>, <i>Deroceras invadens</i>, <i>Arion fasciatus</i>, <i>Limax maximus</i>, <i>Boettgerilla pallens</i>, <i>Deroceras sturanyi</i>, <i>Arion rufus</i>, <i>Arion silvaticus</i>, <i>Lehmannia valentiana</i>, <i>Arion circumscriptus</i> und <i>Deroceras laeve</i>. More species of slug occurred in gardens rated as untidier (<i>p</i> = 0.02). The discovery of <i>L. valentiana</i> is the first outdoors record for G&#246;rlitz. The diverse state of establishment of the other four invasive species is discussed in relation to earlier faunistic data. Our investigation provides a baseline for long-term monitoring of the development of the slug fauna in G&#246;rlitz.

</h2>
Ten towns in the southwest corner of Poland within 57 km of the German border were surveyed for slugs. <i>Deroceras invadens</i> was found only in the four westernmost towns. In Zgorzelec, which was surveyed more intensively than the other towns, it occurs widely but only sporadically. Although <i>D. invadens</i> had been known in the adjacent German town of G&#246;rlitz since 1991, hitherto the only Polish record was from Wroc&#322;aw, 140 km to the east. This pattern suggests a new colonisation across the border. Amongst the other species, one surprise was the rarity of <i>Deroceras reticulatum</i> in several towns, and another that <i>Arion fuscus</i> was common in one town but not found in any of the others. Records of <i>Deroceras praecox</i> extend its known range in Poland further west. Contrary to expectations from the literature, <i>Deroceras sturanyi</i> was adult in spring, and reproducing at a small size typical of <i>Deroceras laeve</i>.

</h2>
Five species of <i>Arion</i> slugs were collected repeatedly at a woodland site in southern England and all individuals weighed. Selected samples of these were dissected so as to weigh components of the reproductive tract. The relative weights of the gonad, spermoviduct and albumen gland provided the basis to categorize individuals into adult, subadult or immature classes, or as juvenile if the sum of these weights was below a threshold. This procedure was validated by raising <i>A. subfuscus</i> in captivity and killing at a range of known ages before and after egg laying. In the other species, organ weights from individuals observed to have laid eggs or mated also helped to calibrate the divisions. Such data from two species demonstrated that, following the production of an egg clutch, the albumen gland took days gradually to regrow. There was little evidence of much variation in life cycle from year to year and the broad patterns, although not precise timings, agreed with studies elsewhere. No species produced more than one generation per year and in all there was a season (brief in <i>A. subfuscus</i>) when adults were absent. The life cycles were predominantly annual, although in some species a minority of individuals might take 18 months to mature. The time of year at which individuals matured into adults varied between species: <i>A. intermedius</i> in August and September, <i>A. distinctus</i> mostly in December and January, <i>A. circumscriptus</i> mostly January to April, <i>A. subfuscus</i> April to early October and <i>A. rufus</i> July to September. The largest two species thus dominated in summer, but at other times the species overlapped considerably in size. In four species, individuals maturing later in the season did so at a smaller size; the possible exception was <i>A. intermedius</i>, in which maturation was highly synchronized. The coefficients of variation in adult size were compared against a collection of such data from other terrestrial molluscs. The smallest species, <i>A. intermedius</i>, had disproportionately large hatchlings.

The family Boettgerillidae, represented by the Eurasian slug <i>Boettgerilla pallens</i> Simroth, 1912, is first recorded for Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada
&#8212a range extension of almost exactly 5000 km within the Americas. Compiled, within an appendix, to provide a national perspective for the Newfoundland and Labrador record, are 13 previously 
unpublished <i>B. pallens</i> records from British Columbia, Canada. Incidentally recorded is the second eastern Canadian outdoor occurrence of the European slug 
<i>Deroceras invadens</i>. This paper is the first in a series that will treat all of the terrestrial molluscs of Newfoundland and Labrador.

</h2>
Two North American slug species are reported from three locations in southern Sweden: three records (in 2005, 2014 and 2015) of <i>Ariolimax columbianus</i> (Gould) and one 2005 record of <i>Prophysaon foliolatum</i> (Gould). The record of <i>P. foliolatum</i> is the first for Europe. In all cases it is highly probable or proven that the slugs had been accidentally imported with ornamental plants from North America, particularly salal, <i>Gaultheria shallon</i> Pursh. Salal is collected on a massive scale from the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Canada and Washington State, and exported as green filler for floral arrangements. The harvest, storage and transport conditions seem perfectly suitable for these slugs, which are not synanthropic but live in natural habitats where salal thrives. We point out that these apparently uncontrolled imports might open the door to the introduction of new, non-synanthropic species.

Das 33. Regionaltreffen der DMG-Arbeitsgruppe Ost fand vom 23.-25.9.2016 im Internationalen
Begegnungszentrum St. Marienthal in Ostritz, Ostsachsen statt. Es kamen 35 Teilnehmer und Begleitpersonen.
Die Sammelexkursion mit einem Schwerpunkt auf Landgastropoden f&#252;hrte am 24. September an drei
Sammelstellen im Ostlausitzer H&#252;gelland: das Naturschutzgebiet des Basaltbergmassivs Rotstein bei Sohland
am Rotstein, ein Teich und Erlenwald bei Sohland und der Basaltberg Eichler bei Rennersdorf. Weitere Aufsammlungen
wurden im Umfeld der Klosters St. Marienthal vorgenommen. Insgesamt wurden 81 Molluskenarten
gesammelt, davon 53 Arten am Rotstein, dem Schwerpunktgebiet der Tagungsexkursion. Zehn Arten wurden
zum ersten Mal auf dem Rotstein nachgewiesen. Insgesamt sind nun 61 Arten f&#252;r den Rotstein nachgewiesen,
was den besonderen Stellenwert des Gebietes f&#252;r die Molluskenfauna der Oberlausitz unterstreicht. Zu den
faunistisch besonders interessanten Arten geh&#246;ren u. a. <i>Vertigo alpestris</i>, <i>Euomphalia strigella</i>, <i>Truncatellina
cylindrica</i> und <i>Vitrea subrimata</i>. Letztere ist gleichzeitig der Erstnachweis für die Oberlausitz, ebenso wie das
Leergeh&#228;use einer <i>Nesovitrea petronella</i> aus dem Erlenwald am Teich bei Sohland. Weitere besonders bemerkenswerte
Funde sind <i>Vitrinobrachium breve</i> vom Eichler und <i>Limacus flavus</i> aus Ostritz, beide in der s&#228;chsischen
Oberlausitz erstmalig au&#223;erhalb der Stadt G&#246rlitz. Leider wurde der invasive <i>Arion lusitanicus</i> auch im

(Linnaeus, 1758) (Pulmonata: Arionidae) from Turkey. <i>Folia Malacologica</i> <b>26</b>: 213&ndash;220. 301&#150;307.
</h2>
A strong population of the terrestrial slug <i>Arion ater</i> s.l. is reported from the European and
Asian parts of Istanbul, Turkey. This is the first confirmed report of this large, conspicuous taxon from
Turkey and from Asia. Our samples from five synanthropic sites indicate that it is already well established.
Partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) place the Turkish slugs
in a small clade shared with a few specimens from western France, perhaps indicating the origin of the
Istanbul population. The next closest haplotypes (9% difference) fall within the clade identified as <i>Arion
ater</i> s.s. This fits with the genital morphology of the Turkish slugs, which is most similar to the <i>ater</i>-form
of <i>A. ater</i> s.l. Our discovery also puts a new light on the recent report of the highly invasive pest slug <i>Arion
lusitanicus</i> auct. non Mabille, 1868 (often called <i>Arion vulgaris</i> Moquin-Tandon, 1855) in Isparta, which was
identified only on the basis of external morphology. As reliable morphological distinction of these two
species requires examination of the genital anatomy, the specimen from Isparta should be reinvestigated.

Colonies originally identified as <i>Monacha cartusiana</i> have often turned out to be <i>M. claustralis</i>. This was the case with a sample collected in 2016 from near Jena, and thus the first record of <i>M. claustralis</i> from Germany. We compare these animals&#039; genital anatomy against several distinguishing characters advocated in the literature. A partial-COI sequence indicates a close genetic relationship with Polish colonies near Gdansk and Kielce. Although originally from western Turkey and adjacent parts of the Balkan Peninsula, <i>M. claustralis</i> is liable to have established itself at other sites in Germany, maybe sometimes hidden in mixed colonies with <i>M. cartusiana</i>, from which it is indistinguishable using external characters.

</h2>
The terrestrial slug <i>Arion vulgaris</i> Moquin-Tandon (= <i>A. lusitanicus</i> auct. non Mabille) is an important agricultural pest that has invaded much of Europe. Previous work has demonstrated hybridisation with <i>A. ater</i> (Linn&#230;us) s.l. We describe the genital anatomy of morphological intermediates found in eastern Saxony (Germany), comparing them with the parent species. We recommend a standard method of genital dissection and consider a set of five genital characters. The intermediates demonstrate the homology of the ligula-bearing organs of the two species; the ancestral position of the ligula in the dilated part of the oviduct has moved to the upper atrium in <i>A. ater</i> s.l. Furthermore we differentiate three morphotypes of <i>A. ater</i> s.l. in eastern Saxony, associated with different mitochondrial DNA sequences. One is <i>A. ater ater</i>, previously unrecognised from this part of Germany and the Czech Republic. The two other morphotypes correspond to the predominantly British and the Continental subspecies previously recognised on genetic and morphological grounds. We designate as the lectotype of <i>Limax rufus</i> Linn&#230;us, 1758 a non-surviving specimen from Almondbury, England, described by Lister; thus the predominantly British subspecies becomes <i>A. ater rufus</i>. The appropriate name for the Continental form is <i>A. ater ruber</i> (Garsault, 1764).

</h2>
The terrestrial slug <i>Deroceras invadens</i> has spread across much of the world over the last century. What is to learn from mitochondrial sequences (partial COI) about the species&#8217; origin, colonisations, and diversity? Samples from 317 localities covering most of its range yielded 87 haplotypes. Higher diversity, the predominance of private haplotypes, and geographic structuring all indicate a native range centred on southern Italy, including eastern Sicily. In contrast, central Italy is dominated by one haplotype, although accompanied by both close and more distant relatives; the lack of geographic structuring suggests recent expansion from a restricted distribution within that region. Beyond the Alps, two haplotypes predominate, accompanied by very similar variants; such star-shaped genealogies characterise recent population growth. Also some rarer haplotypes have been independently introduced. Generally haplotypes are well mixed here, often co-occurring at a locality. In North America and Australasia, some frequent haplotypes were likely directly introduced from Italy, because they were not found elsewhere in Europe. The rarity or absence in these continents of one or other of the two dominant European haplotypes suggests that import inspections have restricted repeated introductions. A skyline plot detects the recent demographic expansion but also indicates an earlier population decline in the native area. This may explain why the one-dimensional summary statistics <i>F<sub>S</sub></i> and <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> did not signal population growth. A review of 41 other studies that used DNA to analyse invasions of terrestrial molluscs documents considerable diversity in methodology. Studies using genetic data to date recent invasions probably should adjust standard substitution rates upwards.

</h2>
Several individuals of the terrestrial slug <i>Deroceras laeve</i> were collected in 2018 in the Hoàng Liên Son mountain range of northern Vietnam. The three specimens which were investigated anatomically were aphallic or hemiphallic. A partial COI sequence verified the species identity. This is the first discovery of <i>D. laeve</i> and also of the slug family Agriolimacidae on the Indochinese Peninsula. The collecting site is situated near a cable-car station and below a tourist complex on Fansipan mountain, both of which had just been built by a Swiss-Austrian company between 2013 and 2016. This and the fact that the species had not been found elsewhere in the surrounding area, although searched for thoroughly, indicate that <i>D. laeve</i> is most probably a recent introduction, potentially with building material from Austria or Switzerland.

</h2>
The terrestrial slug <i>Deroceras cecconii</i> was described from Vallombrosa, a forest in the hills above Florence, Italy. However, its validity has long been disbelieved. Fresh samples from the type locality agreed well with the original description and proved to be distinct in genital anatomy, mating behaviour and COI genetic sequence. Video recordings of the copulation showed that, besides the penial gland, the penis had 2 pockets that evert, the caecum and lobe. The caecum deposits sperm onto the partner’s penis but is short and not always apparent in the retracted state. Many other components of the mating behaviour are modifications of those observed in <i>D. invadens</i>, <i>D. panormitanum</i> and <i>D. golcheri</i>, but the molecular phylogeny, based on the mitochondrial COI gene, did not fully resolve their relationships. Genetically closest to <i>D. cecconii</i> was a slug from the island of Montecristo previously considered possibly to be <i>D. golcheri</i>. <i>Deroceras golcheri</i> and an undescribed close relative from Sicily are liable to be confused with <i>D. cecconii</i> anatomically, but <i>D. cecconii</i> is distinguished by the presence of a lobe and the concave saddle at the proximal end of the penis where the vas deferens inserts. The penis of <i>D. cecconii</i> is less similar to those of <i>D. invadens</i> and <i>D. panormitanum</i>, which both have a long caecum and, usually, lobe. <i>Deroceras cecconii</i> is common and widespread in much of Italy, although not the far south, occurring in a wide range of habitats. Also, a local but persistent population has been introduced to the town of Ostritz on the eastern border of Germany. The genetic uniformity amongst most populations raises the possibility that it might also be an introduction within part of its Italian range.
