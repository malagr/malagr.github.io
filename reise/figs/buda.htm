<IMG SRC="buda.jpg" ALT="[Photo of Tandonia budapestensis]" WIDTH=620 HEIGHT=377><p>(a) <i>Tandonia budapestensis</i> in its typical C-shape resting position within a soil cavity that was topped by a board. The eggs could well be from this specimen. (b) A pair of mating <i>T. budapestensis</i>, as the species is commonly encountered because of its prolonged copulation (typically from evening to midday: Quick 1960). Both pictures from Nork Park allotments, Banstead, Surrey, England.
